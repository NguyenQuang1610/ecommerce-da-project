# E-Commerce Products Analytics & OKR Dashboard
This repository is created to document the findings its process using data analysis of an imaginary e-commerce platform/company. The sample database is a Brazillian's e-commerce website from Kaggle. The scopoe is analyzing user behavior, revenue, and experiments to support product and business decisions.

## Business Context:
This project aims to analyze Olist’s e-commerce operations by answering key business questions across four areas: revenue drivers, product performance, customer experience, and seller behavior.

Specifically, the analysis explores which product categories and regions generate the most delivered revenue, how product attributes and logistics characteristics impact order success, where delivery delays and poor customer experiences originate, and how payment behavior and seller performance vary across the marketplace.

## Business Questions:

### THEME 1 – REVENUE & DEMAND DRIVERS

#### 1. Which product categories contribute the most to completed and delivered revenue, and which categories underperform?

#### 2. How does demand differ across states and cities, and which regions drive the highest order volume and revenue?

#### Metrics:

Revenue per category
Order share by region

### THEME 2 – PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES & PERFORMANCE

#### How do product attributes (name length, description length, number of photos) correlate with order volume and conversion to delivery?

#### Do product size and weight impact shipping outcomes, such as delivery delays or cancellations?

#### Metrics:

Delivery success rate
Late delivery rate

### THEME 3 – CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE & DELIVERY RELIABILITY

#### Which sellers consistently outperform others in terms of delivery reliability, review quality, and order volume, and what product categories do they specialize in?

#### Metrics:
